# 30DayMapChallenge 2020

On the Novemebr 1^st^, Topi Tjukanov [started](https://twitter.com/tjukanov/status/1311568912950140930) a [#30DayMapChallenge 2020](https://twitter.com/hashtag/30DayMapChallenge) - one day, one map, one theme.  Because it is a lot of fun, Geographic Data Science Lab wanted to be a part of it and on 23^rd^ day, it was our turn.

Since the topic was _boundaries_, we decided to sharw with you the process of creation of boundaries of morpohlogical tessellation - the (smallest) spatial unit used in urban morphometrics.
