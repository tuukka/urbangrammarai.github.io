# Firing up the engines

This is the first post going out form the [Urban Grammar project](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/urban-grammar). We will use this blog to keep track of progress on the project and to announce milestones we are reaching along the way. If you are interested in cities, satellites and AI, keep an eye on the blog and feel free to get in touch with either [Dani](mailto:darribas-bel@turing.ac.uk) or [Martin](mailto:M.Fleischmann@liverpool.ac.uk)!
